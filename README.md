# joel_koltner_tsc
Joel Koltners Tektronics Screen dump utility (Py-WxWidgets)

The original version work nicely with python2.7 and wxPython 2.8.12.1 which is still 
available but not supported anymore. It is also quite difficult to install on modern Linux
distribution.

The current version is tested with python 3.13 and wxPython 4.2.3 on Windows but it should work on Linux as well.

To run the program install python from https://python.org.
Then run pip install wxPython
